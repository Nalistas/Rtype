 The {\ttfamily react-\/router} package is the heart of \href{https://github.com/remix-run/react-router}{\texttt{ React Router}} and provides all the core functionality for both \href{https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/packages/react-router-dom}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily react-\/router-\/dom}}} and \href{https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/packages/react-router-native}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily react-\/router-\/native}}}.

If you\textquotesingle{}re using React Router, you should never {\ttfamily import} anything directly from the {\ttfamily react-\/router} package, but you should have everything you need in either {\ttfamily react-\/router-\/dom} or {\ttfamily react-\/router-\/native}. Both of those packages re-\/export everything from {\ttfamily react-\/router}.

If you\textquotesingle{}d like to extend React Router and you know what you\textquotesingle{}re doing, you should add {\ttfamily react-\/router} {\bfseries{as a peer dependency, not a regular dependency}} in your package.
